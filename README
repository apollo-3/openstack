# In order to reach private ips of your VMs do the next things
iptables -X
iptables -F
route add -net 192.168.100.0/24 gw 10.0.2.100

# Please reboot vagrant box after installation and add route and clean iptables as above to be able to use VNC from the dachboard 

# After installation default security group should be fine however make sure that all ingress and egress traffic is allowed
# Create public network and subnet with FLAT type and assign real vagrant gateway (physical network: br-ex)
# Create private network and subnet and connect it to public subnet via router which you also have to create
# Create VM only with private ip at first and only afterwards assign floating ip. The opposite behavior leads to errors during VM building
